"""Stamp the site's CSS and JS links with a content hash.

Cloudflare tells browsers to keep CSS and JS for 4 hours. Without a version in
the URL, anyone who visited in that window keeps the old file after a deploy,
so new pages render with old styles. Each link gets ?v=<first 10 hex of the
file's SHA-256>, so a changed file gets a new URL and is fetched fresh.

Run after editing styles.css, script.js or the web3d bundle:
    python3 scripts/stamp_assets.py
scripts/check_site.py fails in CI when a stamp is missing or stale.
